### I only use GitHub to upload the Stickfigurate files and that's it. All my game dev work is being done on private Bitbucket repositories. If GitHub allowed for a slightly bigger filesize and allowed for free private repositories within that file size limit (said projects are being worked on in UE4, which can take up a lot of space even if optimized) then I would use this, however I have moved on. If I can any small projects, I can put it here, but for now it's mainly for one repository and that's about it.
